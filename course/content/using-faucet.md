## Overview 
To make sure that user's BNB tokens don't get wasted in the testing of their dApps/smart contrats, BNB Chain provides them the alternative to use Test Tokens (tBNB) on the BNB Smart Chain Testnet instead. BNB Smart Chain also provides a testnet faucet for acquring test tokens. In this lesson, we provide a brief guide on how to use the official faucet to get test tokens for use on the BNB Smart Chain testnet.

## What is a faucet
A faucet is a service that provides free testnet tokens for developers who want to test their dApps or transactions on BNB Smart Chain without using real funds. 

## How to use the faucet for test tokens

To use a BNB Smart Chain testnet faucet, you need to follow these steps:

1. Connect your web3 wallet (such as MetaMask) to the BNB Smart Chain testnet network. Refer [here](connect-web3-wallet) for more details.

2. Go to a [faucet website](https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart) that supports BNB Smart Chain testnet.

3. Copy your wallet address and paste it into the input feild on the faucet website.
4. Click on "Give me BNB" and then on "0.1 BNB".

> Make sure to avoid click jacking the faucet website. If you click unnecessarily on the faucet website, this will result in you getting blocked for 24 hours and termed as a bot.

You can use the testnet tokens to interact with dApps or smart contracts on BNB Smart Chain testnet. You can also check your balance and transactions on BSCScan.
