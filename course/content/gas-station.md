## Lesson Objectives
*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Understand what a Gas Tracker is 
- Understand what is BNB Smart Chain's Gas Tracker 
- Understand what can be done using the BNB Smart Chain's Gas Tracker

## Overview
BNB Smart Chain gas trackers are essential tools that provide users with real-time information about gas fees, network congestion, and transaction confirmation times, enabling them to make more informed decisions about their transactions on the BNB Smart Chain network.

## What is a Gas Tracker
A gas tracker in blockchain is a tool that allows users to monitor and track the amount of gas being used by transactions on the network1. Gas is a measure of computational effort required to execute a transaction on the blockchain, and is necessary to prevent spamming and other such activities on the network. Gas is usually denominated in a smaller unit of the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain, such as Gwei for Ethereum or BNB for BNB Smart Chain.

## What is BNB Smart Chain Gas Tracker
[BNB Smart Chain Gas Tracker](https://bscscan.com/gastracker) is a feature on [BscScan](https://bscscan.com) that allows you to estimate the gas price and fees for sending transactions on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) network. Gas is the unit of measure for the computational work done by the validators on BSC. Gas price is the amount of BNB that you are willing to pay per unit of gas. Gas fees are the total amount of BNB that you pay for a transaction, which is calculated by multiplying the gas price and the gas limit (the maximum amount of gas that you are willing to spend for a transaction).

## What can be BNB Smart Chain Gas Station be used for 

You can use BNB Smart Chain Gas Tracker to:

1. View the current standard, fast and rapid gas prices in Gwei (1 Gwei = 0.000000001 BNB) and USD, as well as the average confirmation time for each gas price level.
2. View the pending transaction pool information, such as the last block number, pending queue size, average block size, average utilization and last refreshed time.
3. View the gas guzzlers and gas spenders charts, which show the top 25 contracts or accounts that consume or send a lot of gas in the last 5 minutes.
4. View the gas price history chart, which shows the daily average gas price used on the network in Gwei2.
5. View other gas analytics and statistics for BSC, such as gas cost by date, gas unit price by date, gas usage by protocol and more3.
