## Lesson Objectives 
*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Learn about the dev tools provided by BNB Chain 

## Overview 
BNB Chain, in particular, BNB Smart Chain, is a blockchain platform designed to provide a high-performance infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps). Based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), BSC offers compatibility with the existing Ethereum toolchain, including Solidity, Remix, Truffle, Metamask, etc. There than these BSC provides a vast range of dev tools to empoer its dev communtiy.

## Dev Tools Offered by BNB Chain

There are many tools available for developers who want to build on BNB Chain, such as:

* **Wallets:** Trust Wallet, MetaMask, TokenPocket, etc.
* **Explorers:** BscScan, BSCTrace, MINTSCAN, etc.
* **IDEs:** Truffle, Remix, ChainIDE, BNB Chain Studio, etc.
