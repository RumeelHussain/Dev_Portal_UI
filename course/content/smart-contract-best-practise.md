## Overview
Smart contract security is critical in ensuring that blockchain-based applications are secure and trustworthy. In this lesson we list some of the best practices for smart contract security.

## How to secure your smart contracts

Smart contract security is critical in ensuring that blockchain-based applications are secure and trustworthy. Here are some best practices for smart contract security:

* **Use well-audited libraries:** Always use well-audited libraries and smart contract templates. Avoid writing code from scratch as it increases the risk of vulnerabilities.

* **Follow secure coding guidelines:** Use secure coding guidelines such as the Solidity Style Guide to avoid common programming mistakes that can lead to security vulnerabilities.

* **Code review:** Have experienced developers review the code for potential security risks. This can help detect and fix vulnerabilities early on in the development process.

* **Use formal verification:** Use formal verification tools to ensure the correctness and security of the smart contract. Formal verification is a mathematical technique that can help detect and eliminate errors in the code.

* **Limit the scope of the contract:** Keep the scope of the contract limited to the necessary functionality. This helps reduce the potential attack surface.

* **Test thoroughly:** Thoroughly test the smart contract using a variety of scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected and to identify any vulnerabilities.

* **Use multi-sig wallets:** Use multi-signature wallets to ensure that multiple parties are required to approve any transactions, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

* **Keep contracts simple:** Keep the smart contract simple and easy to understand to avoid unintended interactions with other contracts or vulnerabilities.

* **Monitor the contract:** Monitor the contract continuously to detect any potential security breaches or unusual activity.

* **Be transparent:** Be transparent about the smart contract's security vulnerabilities, and communicate any security risks to users and stakeholders.

By following these best practices, you can help ensure that your smart contracts are secure and trustworthy, and can help to build confidence in the blockchain-based applications that use them.
