# Build a Bike Rental Dapp on BSC

## Learning Objectives
*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Use Remix IDE for writing, compiling and deploying smart contracts
- Use Remix IDE to interact with deployed smart contracts


## Video Demo
In this video tutorial, we use the Remix IDE to create a Bike Rental Smart Contract called "Bikechain" on the BNB Smart Chain network. The smart contract has the functionality to allow people to rent bikes. They can check it out (via a transaction on the Blockchain) and ride around town. When they return it, they'll check it back in (again a transaction), and will have a balance due. We also discuss how to calculate that ride duration, pay the dues, and even credit the account by sending money to the smart contract ahead of time. 

### Tools Used
