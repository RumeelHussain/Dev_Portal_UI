# Course Overview

## Welcome to BnB Chain 101 Course!

In this course, you will learn about [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/en), a decentralized blockchain network that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the BNB Chain and its underlying technology. As a developer, you will learn how to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and explore the various tools, APIs, and frameworks available for this purpose.

The course will start with an introduction to blockchain technology and its use cases. You will then learn about BNB Chain, its architecture, and how it differs from other blockchain platforms. We will cover the consensus mechanism, underlying architecture, benefits and use-cases of the different blockchain solutions that are part of the BNB Chain ecosystem.

You will also gain an in-depth understanding of BNB Chain and its components, such as nodes, validators, and smart contracts. You will explore the BNB Smart Chain's EVM-compatible environment and learn how to use Web3.js, Solidity, and other developer tools to build dApps on the BNB Smart Chain.

Throughout the course, you will learn about the various use cases for BNB Chain, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

At the end of the course, you will have gained the knowledge and skills necessary to build, deploy, and maintain decentralized applications on the BNB Smart Chain. You will have a deep understanding of BNB Chain's architecture and how it works, as well as the various tools and frameworks available for developers to build on the platform.

Join us on this exciting journey, become a skilled developer, and excel your career as a Web3 builder on the BNB Chain.
