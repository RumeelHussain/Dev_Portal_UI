## Lesson Objectives
*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Understand what blockchain technology is 
- Understand the potential use-cases for blockchain

## Overview
Blockchain technology is a way of storing and sharing information across a network of users in an open virtual space. Blockchain technology allows for users to look at the same information at the same time. However, it does not allow for users to change or edit the information.

Blockchain technology consists of blocks that store data or information, and each block is connected to the previous one through a cryptographic code, forming a chain. Each block also has a timestamp and a unique identifier. This makes the data in the blockchain secure, transparent and immutable.

Other than use for crytpocurrencies, Blockchain technology can also be used in several different potential use cases, for e.g., identity mananagement, decentralized storage, real estate, etc.

## What is blockchain technology
Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent way. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered without the consensus of the network. This creates a tamper-proof and highly secure system that can be used for a variety of applications.

One of the most well-known use cases for blockchain technology is cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These digital currencies rely on blockchain technology to enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a centralized authority.

## Potential Use-cases

Blockchain technology has a wide range of potential use cases beyond cryptocurrencies. Here are some examples of how blockchain can be used in various industries:

* **Supply Chain Management:** Blockchain can be used to improve transparency and traceability in supply chains. By creating a secure and tamper-proof record of every transaction, companies can track the movement of goods and verify their origin, reducing the risk of counterfeit products entering the market. Blockchain can also help streamline the supply chain by reducing paperwork and improving efficiency.

* **Identity Management:** Blockchain technology can provide a secure and decentralized system for managing identity information. Individuals can store their personal information on the blockchain, and control who has access to it. This can reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud, as well as provide a convenient way to verify identity online.

* **Voting Systems:** Blockchain can be used to create secure and transparent voting systems. By recording votes on a decentralized ledger, it is possible to prevent fraud and ensure that votes are counted accurately. This can increase voter trust and participation in the democratic process.

* **Smart Contracts:** Blockchain technology can enable the creation of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into code. This can help automate many business processes, reduce the need for intermediaries, and ensure that agreements are fulfilled.

* **Decentralized Storage:** Blockchain technology can be used to create decentralized storage solutions that are more secure and resilient than traditional centralized storage. By storing data across a distributed network of nodes, it is possible to prevent data loss and ensure that data is always available.

* **Healthcare:** Blockchain can be used to improve the security and privacy of healthcare data. By using a decentralized system for storing and sharing medical records, it is possible to ensure that patients have control over their data and that it is only accessible to authorized parties.

* **Real Estate:** Blockchain can be used to streamline the process of buying and selling real estate. By recording property transactions on a blockchain, it is possible to reduce the need for intermediaries, speed up the process, and reduce the risk of fraud.

These are just a few examples of how blockchain technology can be used. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications emerge in various industries.
