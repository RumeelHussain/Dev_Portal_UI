# Course Introduction

## Overview
The BNB Chain 101 course is designed for developers wanting to learn how to develop applications on the BNB Chain. This course covers the theoretical fundamentals as well as the practical demonstration of developing smart contracts and decentralized applications on the BNB Chain. As BNB Smart Chain is the blockchain component of the BNB Chain ecosystem that supports the smart contract programmability, hence all the dapps and smart contracts are deployed on the BNB Smart Chain network.

## BNB Chain Ecosystem
Build N Build Chain aka BNB Chain, one of the most popular blockchains in the world, dedicates to delivering its core infrastructure necessary for future public adoption, and always remains as a community-first and open-source ecosystem built on a permissionless and decentralized environment.
BNB Chain is composed of two blockchains - [BNB Beacon Chain (BC)](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/learn/beaconIntro/) and [BNB Smart Chain (BSC)](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/learn/intro). The BNB Beacon Chain is the blockchain component that is responsible for the governance of the BNB Chain as well as the staking and voting on the BNB Chain. Whereas the BNB Smart Chain is the blockchain component that is EVM compatible, consensus layers, and with hubs to multi-chains. BNB Chain, one of the most popular blockchains in the world, dedicates to delivering its core infrastructure necessary for future public adoption, and always remains a community-first and open-source ecosystem built on a permissionless and decentralized environment.

### What is Build N Build (BNB) Chain?â€‹
BNB Chain is comprised of:
* [BNB Beacon Chain](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/learn/beaconIntro) - BNB Beacon Chain is the staking and governance layer of the BNB ecosystem.
* [BNB Smart Chain (BSC)](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/learn/intro) - An EVM-compatible blockchain that brings programmability and interoperability to the BNB ecosystem.
* [ZkBNB](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/zkbnb/zkbnb-overview) - ZkBNB is an infrastructure that is built on ZK Rollup architecture for developers that helps them to build large-scale BSC-based apps with higher throughput and much lower or even zero transaction fees.
* [BNB Greenfield](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/greenfield/overview) - BNB Greenfield introduces an entirely new structural and economic paradigm for data in the Web3 era. The ownership, usage, and monetization of data are now possible first and foremost for users, as well as all participants in the BNB Chain ecosystem.

## Target Audience
* For Web2 developers wanting to learn blockchain development on the BNB Chain.
* For newbies desiring to learn web3 development using the BNB Chain ecosystem.

## BNB Smart Chain -  The Programmability Gaint of BNB Chain
BNB Chain is an ecosystem of blockchains. BNB Smart Chain is the blockchain component of the BNB Chain ecosystem that provides smart contract functionality. Therefore, all of the Web3 and dapp development is done on the BNB Smart Chain. In this BNB Chain 101 course, we target the dapp development on the BNB Smart Chain and the terms BNB Chain and BNB Smart Chain is referred to interchangeably.
