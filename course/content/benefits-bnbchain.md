# Benefits of Using BNB Chain
BNB Chain has tons of benefits to offer to both developers and general users. Below we list some of these.

## For Developers

* **Permissionless:** BNB Chain is a decentralized network that allows anyone to participate and transact.
Easy to Use: BNB Chain provides a user-friendly interface and development tools that simplify the process of building and deploying decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain.
* **Efficient and Cost-Effective:** Developing and deploying DApps on BNB Chain is relatively inexpensive compared to other blockchain platforms, as BNB Chain uses the Proof-of-Staked-Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism that consumes less energy, requires lower transaction fees and results into more efficient and faster transactions.
* **Interoperability:** BNB Chain supports interoperability with other blockchains, enabling developers to create cross-chain applications and facilitate asset transfers between different blockchains.
* **High Performance:** BNB Chain's high throughput and low latency make it an ideal platform for developing applications that require fast transaction processing and high performance.
* **Incentives:** BNB Chain is a protocol that supports projects through several initiatives like [MVB Program](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bsc-mvb-program), [Revelation Hackathon](https://bnbchain.org/en/revelation-hackathon), [ZeroToHero Builder Series](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/zero2hero-builder-series), etc.
* **Open-source:** BNB Chain is an open-source protocol that promotes transparency, trust, collaboration, and innovation.
User Engagement: BNB Chain is known for its high daily user engagement, large user base and wide reach.
EVM Compatible: BNB Chain is EVM-compatible, enabling high interoperability and Solidity development.

## For General Users

* **Low Transaction Fees:** BNB Chain's low transaction fees make it an attractive platform for users who want to send or receive digital assets without incurring high fees.
* **Security:** BNB Chain's PoSA consensus mechanism provides a high level of security against malicious attacks, ensuring that user assets are protected at all times.
* **Decentralized Governance:** BNB Chain is governed by a decentralized community of stakeholders who can propose and vote on changes to the protocol, making it a truly decentralized platform.
* **Wide Range of Use Cases:** BNB Chain supports a wide range of use cases, including decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, gaming, and more, providing users with a diverse ecosystem of applications and services to choose from.
