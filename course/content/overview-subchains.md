# Blockchain Components of the BNB Chain Ecosystem 

## Lesson Objectives
*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Distinguish between the different components of the BNB Chain ecosystem.
- Establish understanding of the blockchain components as well as of their use-cases.

## Overview 
BNB Chain is an ecosystem of several blockchains that offers different functionalities. In this lesson we provide an overview of these several components for our readers to have an understanding of when to use a particular blockchain component.

## BNB Chain - An Ecosystem of Multiple Blockchains
The BNB Chain ecosystem consists of several sub-components that work together to create a decentralized, efficient, and secure blockchain network. Here's a brief overview of some of the main sub-components:

* **BNB Smart Chain (BSC):** BNB Smart Chain is a parallel blockchain network that runs alongside the Beacon Chain. It is designed to be EVM-compatible, meaning that it can support applications and smart contracts written in Solidity, the same programming language used for Ethereum. BSC uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA), which combines Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Authority (PoA) to achieve high transaction throughput and low fees.

* **Beacon Chain:** Beacon Chain is the underlying blockchain network that powers the Beacon ecosystem. It is a high-performance blockchain that is optimized for fast transactions and low fees. Beacon Chain uses a consensus mechanism called Tendermint, which allows for fast block confirmation times and high transaction throughput.

* **BNB Sidechains:** Sidechains can be used to add new features or functionality to the BNB Smart Chain without affecting the main BNB Smart Chain. It is a framework for creating sidechains in the BSC (BNB Smart Chain) ecosystem.It is an infrastructure to help developers and node operators build and run their custom blockchains as their internal value system and for a massive number of users while still maintaining a close connection with the BSC. 

* **ZkBNB:** zkBNB is built on ZK (Zero Knowledge) Rollup architecture. ZK Rollups is a Layer-2 solution where all the computations and state changes are done off-chain, that is on a sidechain. In this architecture, a summary of the changes along.

* **BNB Greenfield:** The goal of the BNB Greenfield is to unleash the power of decentralized blockchain and storage technology on data ownership and data economy. BNB Greenfield is not only a new blockchain in BNB but also an infrastructure and ecosystem targeting to facilitate the decentralized data economy. It tries to achieve it by easing the process to store and manage data access and linking data ownership with the massive DeFi context of BSC.

## Conclusion
Overall, the BNB Chain ecosystem offers a wide range of blockchain solutions and technologies, from privacy-focused tokens to high-performance blockchain networks, to sidechains that enable new use cases and applications.

In the upcoming lessons, we provide a general overview of each component explicitly.
